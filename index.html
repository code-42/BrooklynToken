            <h1>Welcome to the Brooklyn Token Ethereum dApp.</h1> 
            You must have MetaMask installed in your Chrome Firefox or Opera browser for this (and any) blockchain app to work.
            So if you don't have MetaMask installed, head on over to  https://metamask.io/
            This is a small simple app (dApp) that transfers tokens from one blockchain address to another.
            It doesn't do much else yet, but it's the beginning of my blockchain programming journey.
            Thinking long term, an app like this could be used to pay your bills with onLine banking, 
            or send money (Ether) to another person or entity, or engage in online gambling or lottery tickets, and have an immutable record of that transaction. 
            The front end you see here is written in ReactJS, and the back end is written in Solidity.
            The back end is a verified contract hosted on the Ropsten Etherscan TestNet => 
            https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xd74a0f3606dbc4ad636760a751ecacbbc294d288#code

        Token Name: <span id="tokenName"></span><br>
        Token Symbol: <span id="tokenSymbol"></span><br>
        Total Supply: <span id="initialSupply"></span><br>
        
        <br>
        Transfer to: <input type="text" id="to_address" value="0x14723a09acff6d2a60dcdf7aa4aff308fddc160c" /><br><br>
        Transfer amount: <input type="text" id="transfer_amount" value="2" />
        <button id="transfer">Transfer</button>

        <p>After you submit the transfer, Metamask will ask for confirmation.
            <br>
            It takes several seconds to return because the transaction
            has to be approved.  That's just the way the blockchain works.
